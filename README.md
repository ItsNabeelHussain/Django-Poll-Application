# Django-Poll-Application
Django is a python-based web framework that follows the model-template-view architechtual pattern. Django is fast, secure, and scalable! This is my first Django project, a simple poll app built with help from this tutorial. It consists of a public site that lets people view polls and vote in them, as well as an admin site to add, change, and delete polls.

## Getting Started
### Initial Steps

1. Make new virtualenv: virtualenv env
2. Activate the virtualenv: source env/bin/activate
3. nstall Django pip install Django
4. Edit docs/settings.py to match your timezone
5. Run the server python mange.py runserver
6. Open website http://localhost:8000/polls/ or http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/, 
if you'd like to go admin page http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ (admin:password123)
